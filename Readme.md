# Darkness Improved
Darkness Spell improved to be able to target items (As it should be).

## Contributing
Mod is redundant as it is also implemented in [5e Spells mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/125), under ï»¿5e Spells Adjust.
As such, this repository will be archived.

## Installation
This mod works with [Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager), and possibly Vortex and Manual
Installations. BG3 Mod Managers is by far the simplest method, and as such is recommended one.
